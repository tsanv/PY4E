What do we do to a Python statement that is immediately after an if statement to indicate that the statement is to be executed only when the if statement is true?

 Begin the statement with a curly brace {
 Indent the line below the if statement
 Start the statement with a "#" character
 Underline all of the conditional code

Answer:Indent the line below the if statement

Which of these operators is not a comparison / logical operator?

 !=
 =
 >=
 ==
 >

Answer: =

What is true about the following code segment:
if  x == 5 :
    print('Is 5')
    print('Is Still 5')
    print('Third 5')

 The string 'Is 5' will always print out regardless of the value for x.
 Depending on the value of x, either all three of the print statements will execute or none of the statements will execute
 The string 'Is 5' will never print out regardless of the value for x.
 Only two of the three print statements will print out if the value of x is less than zero.

Answer: Depending on the value of x, either all three of the print statements will execute or none of the statements will execute

When you have multiple lines in an if block, how do you indicate the end of the if block?

 You omit the semicolon ; on the last line of the if block
 You de-indent the next line past the if block to the same level of indent as the original if statement
 You capitalize the first letter of the line following the end of the if block
 You use a curly brace { after the last line of the if block

Answer:You de-indent the next line past the if block to the same level of indent as the original if statement

You look at the following text:
if x == 6 :
    print('Is 6')
    print('Is Still 6')
    print('Third 6')
It looks perfect but Python is giving you an 'Indentation Error' on the second print statement. What is the most likely reason?
 
 Python thinks 'Still' is a mis-spelled word in the string
 You have mixed tabs and spaces in the file
 Python has reached its limit on the largest Python program that can be run
 In order to make humans feel inadequate, Python randomly emits 'Indentation Errors' on perfectly good code - after about an hour the error will just go away without any changes to your program

Answer:  You have mixed tabs and spaces in the file

What is the Python reserved word that we use in two-way if tests to indicate the block of code that is to be executed if the logical test is false?

 A closing curly brace followed by an open curly brace like this }{
 else
 iterate
 otherwise

Answer: else

What will the following code print out?
x = 0
if x < 2 :
    print('Small')
elif x < 10 :
    print('Medium')
else :
    print('LARGE')
print('All done')

 Small 
 Medium 
 LARGE 
 All done

 Small 
 All done

 Medium 
 All done

 Small

Answer: 
Small 
All done

For the following code,
if x < 2 :
    print('Below 2')
elif x >= 2 :
     print('Two or more')
else :
    print('Something else')
What value of 'x' will cause 'Something else' to print out?
 x = 2
 This code will never print 'Something else' regardless of the value for 'x'
 x = 2.0
 x = -2

Answer:This code will never print 'Something else' regardless of the value for 'x'

In the following code (numbers added) - which will be the last line to execute successfully?
(1)   astr = 'Hello Bob'
(2)   istr = int(astr)
(3)   print('First', istr)
(4)   astr = '123'
(5)   istr = int(astr)
(6)   print('Second', istr)
 
 3
 1
 6
 2

Answer: 1

For the following code:
astr = 'Hello Bob'
istr = 0
try:
    istr = int(astr)
except:
    istr = -1
What will the value be for istr after this code executes?
 
 The istr variable will not have a value
 -1
 0
 It will be the 'Not a number' value (i.e. NaN)

Answer: -1
